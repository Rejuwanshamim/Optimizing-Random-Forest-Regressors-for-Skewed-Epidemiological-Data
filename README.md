# Optimizing-Random-Forest-Regressors-for-Skewed-Epidemiological-Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the predictive modeling of global dengue fever outbreaks using historical epidemiological data, with the primary objective of accurately forecasting the total number of dengue cases (dengue_total) across various regions and timeframes. A significant challenge in this analysis was the highly right-skewed nature of the target variable, where case counts ranged from 0 to over 10 million. To address this, the project implements rigorous preprocessing techniques, including a $log(1+x)$ transformation to normalize the distribution, and benchmarks multiple regression algorithms. The final analysis demonstrates that an aggressively tuned Random Forest Regressor yields the highest predictive accuracy, effectively handling the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was collected from the OpenDengue Platform and provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal record of dengue incidence. The raw data consists of approximately 29,873 entries spanning from the year 1924 to 2025, with the majority of observations concentrated in recent years. It covers a global scope, including data from countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Colombia, Brazil, and Vietnam. Key features used in the analysis include temporal markers like Year and duration_days (derived from start and end dates), geospatial identifiers (adm_0_name), and standardized medical case definitions such as "Suspected" or "Confirmed".

## Methodology
The modeling pipeline follows a rigorous data science workflow designed to handle the specific idiosyncrasies of epidemiological data. The process begins with data cleaning, where columns with 100% missing values and irrelevant metadata (such as UUIDs) are removed. To tackle the extreme skewness of the infection counts, the target variable undergoes a $log(1+x)$ transformation. Categorical variables are one-hot encoded, and numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure model stability. The study benchmarks diverse algorithms, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The optimization phase focuses heavily on Random Forest Regressors, utilizing both GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split.
## Key 
ResultsThe analysis identifies the Aggressively Tuned Random Forest (RandomizedSearch) as the best-performing model, achieving an $R^2$ score of 0.881313. This represents a significant improvement over the baseline Linear Regression model, which achieved an $R^2$ of roughly 0.77, and the standard Gradient Boosting model, which scored approximately 0.6014. Feature importance analysis reveals that the Year of the record and specific high-burden locations, particularly BRAZIL and COLOMBIA, are the most significant predictors of dengue outbreak intensity.
